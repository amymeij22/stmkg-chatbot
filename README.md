## Introduction
This project focuses on the development of an intelligent and effective chatbot assistant for Sekolah Tinggi Meteorologi Klimatologi dan Geofisika (STMKG). By leveraging the Fine-Tuned Gemini model and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches, the chatbot aims to provide accurate and relevant responses to user queries. Designed as a web-based assistant, this chatbot improves efficiency and effectiveness in delivering information and services to users.

## Objectives
- Develop a responsive, user-friendly, and informative chatbot assistant tailored to STMKG's needs.
- Fine-tune the Gemini model to enhance its ability to understand and respond to user queries.
- Integrate real-time weather and earthquake data from BMKG to provide accurate and up-to-date information.

## Project Workflow
### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Data Scraping**: Extracted relevant data from the STMKG website.
   - **Data Preparation**: Organized input-output patterns, cleaned, and formatted the dataset for training.

### 2. **Model Fine-Tuning**
   - Used the Gemini 1.5 Flash model as the base.
   - Fine-tuned with 232 examples over 5 epochs, batch size of 4, and a learning rate of 0.001.
   - Enhanced the model's performance in understanding user questions and generating appropriate responses.

### 3. **Integration and Deployment**
   - Integrated the Fine-Tuned Gemini model with open BMKG data for real-time weather and earthquake updates.
   - Deployed the chatbot on a simple and user-friendly web interface.

### 4. **Testing and Evaluation**
   - Conducted final evaluations to assess the chatbot's responsiveness, accuracy, and usability.
   - The model demonstrated strong performance in understanding and responding to user queries effectively.

## Key Features
- **Responsive and Informative**: Provides accurate answers to user queries.
- **Real-Time Data Access**: Delivers up-to-date weather and earthquake information from BMKG.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for easy access and interaction.

## Results
The Fine-Tuned Gemini model demonstrated excellent results in understanding and responding to user queries. The chatbot system is responsive, user-friendly, and informative, making it an effective tool for providing information and services at STMKG.

## Recommendations
- Regularly update the training dataset to maintain relevance and improve the chatbot's performance.
- Consider integrating the chatbot with other platforms to expand its reach and utility.

## Usage
1. Access the chatbot through the provided web interface.
2. Ask questions related to STMKG, weather, or earthquakes.
3. Receive accurate and real-time responses tailored to your queries.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand the dataset with more diverse examples.
- Integrate the chatbot with social media platforms for broader accessibility.
- Add multilingual support to cater to a wider audience.
